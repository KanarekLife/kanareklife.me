                    <h4>eru</h4>
                    <p>
                        eru is a project created in cooperation with my friend from school <a href="https://github.com/bazik33">Bazik33</a> and its goal is to create a great platform through which our school would be able to send substitutions quickly.
                        Currently the substitutions are simply uploaded to website and a lot of students misses them.
                        This project includes upload page that dynamically parses file to xml and uploads it into server, from which it automatically sends a notification to registered people via discord and fb messenger.
                        Our sub-goal for this project was to try and grasp as much of clean architecture rules as possible (I'm leading in this task).
                        Project includes using many popular techniques like: Mediator Pattern (achieved via mediatR), CQRS Pattern, Unit testing, Integration testing.

                    <h4>SuperGamblino</h4>
                    <p>
                        SuperGamblino is a discord bot which goal was to allow users to 'gamble' (on points of course ðŸ˜‰). The project is written with DSharpPlus. The project was written by me and (mostly) two other people that I've via github issues.
                        Bot included coinflip, leaderboard, roulette and slots. Bot was used in some servers, however the project died due to lack of time of my others.

                    <h4>WokLearner</h4>
                    <p>
                        WokLearner was another project written for school. Project was written in Angular and .NET Core (as an API). Its goal was to help my fellow students study for end-of-year arts exam which consisted of several painting that you had to name the author and 'age' of creation.
                        Several people registered and used it however due to exam cancellation (due to COVID-19) it did not reached the peak is should have. Application consists of an gallery of paitings and a small quiz that allowed to train for the exam.

                    <h4>rust_figlet</h4>
                    <p>
                        rust_figlet is my own figlet alternative. It is compatible with a lot of figlet fonts. It automatically downloads the fonts to users computer on the first run. There is an online version that you can try out! At the beginning the project was written in C# however due to quite a big size of the binary I've decided to rewrite it.

                    <h4>KanarDrive</h4>
                    <p>
                        Despite the project is not finished I think it is quite interesting. I've created a GoogleDrive rip off with my own custom file browser in ASP.Net Core that uses LiteDB as storage system. The functionalities include uploading files, moving files around in a directory like environment and sharing files via a link.
